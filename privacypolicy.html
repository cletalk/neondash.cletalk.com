  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>  
  <p>Last updated: 1 December 2025</p>  
  
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Neon Dash (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information when you use the Neon Dash mobile game (the “Game”). By playing the Game, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>  
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>  
  <p>We do not ask you to create an account and we do not collect your name, email address, or direct contact details inside the Game.</p>  
  <p>However, the Game and the advertising partners integrated into it may collect certain types of information automatically:</p>  
  <ul>  
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> such as device model, operating system, language, country, IP address (usually shortened or anonymized by our partners), and device identifiers used for advertising (for example, Android Advertising ID).</li>  
    <li><strong>Usage information:</strong> such as how often you play, in-game events (game over, rewarded ad watched), time spent in the Game, and basic diagnostic information (crashes or errors).</li>  
    <li><strong>Ad information:</strong> such as when an ad is loaded, shown, clicked, or when a reward is earned.</li>  
  </ul>  
  
  <h2>2. Local Game Data (On Your Device)</h2>  
  <p>The Game stores some data locally on your device, for example:</p>  
  <ul>  
    <li>Total EXP and best runs</li>  
    <li>Total coins and purchased scenery</li>  
    <li>Basic gameplay statistics (such as games played)</li>  
  </ul>  
  <p>This data stays on your device and is not automatically sent to us as personally identifiable information.</p>  
  
  <h2>3. Third-Party Advertising Partners</h2>  
  <p>The Game uses third-party advertising networks to show ads and rewarded videos. These partners may collect and process data as separate controllers under their own privacy policies. They may use device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to provide, measure, and improve ads, and to detect fraud or abuse.</p>  
  <p>The main networks we currently integrate include (but may not be limited to):</p>  
  <ul>  
    <li>Google AdMob</li>  
    <li>Unity Ads</li>  
    <li>Meta (Facebook) Audience Network</li>  
    <li>Chartboost</li>  
  </ul>  
  <p>We recommend reviewing their privacy policies to understand how they handle your data and how you can exercise your rights or control personalized advertising through their settings or your device settings.</p>  
  
  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>  
  <p>We and our partners may use information for purposes such as:</p>  
  <ul>  
    <li>Showing and rewarding ads (for example, giving you coins after you watch a rewarded ad)</li>  
    <li>Improving stability, performance, and user experience in the Game</li>  
    <li>Detecting, preventing, or addressing fraud, abuse, or technical issues</li>  
    <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>  
  </ul>  
  
  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>  
  <p>The Game is intended for a general audience but is not designed for children under the age required by your local laws for online consent (for example, 13 or 16). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through the Game, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>  
  
  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>  
  <p>Local game data (such as your scores and coins) is stored on your device until you uninstall the Game, clear the app data, or reset it from your device settings.</p>  
  <p>Our third-party partners may keep certain data for as long as necessary for their purposes, such as analytics, ad reporting, and legal obligations, according to their own policies.</p>  
  
  <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>  
  <p>You may have several options to limit or control data collection:</p>  
  <ul>  
    <li>Disable personalized ads or reset your advertising ID in your device settings.</li>  
    <li>Limit tracking or enable privacy features provided by your device or operating system.</li>  
    <li>Stop using the Game and uninstall it if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy.</li>  
  </ul>  
  
  <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>  
  <p>Because ad networks and other partners operate globally, your data may be processed on servers located in different countries. These countries may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.</p>  
  
  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>  
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the Game after changes means you accept the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
