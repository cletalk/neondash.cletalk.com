  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 1 December 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Neon Dash mobile game (the “Game”). By installing or playing the Game, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Game.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the Game</h2>
  <p>You are granted a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the Game solely for your own entertainment, subject to these Terms and applicable laws.</p>
  <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer, modify, or attempt to extract the source code of the Game, except where explicitly permitted by law.</li>
    <li>Use cheats, automation tools, bots, or any other unauthorized third-party software that interferes with the Game.</li>
    <li>Use the Game for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, or in a way that may harm the Game, our systems, or other players.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Virtual Items and Coins</h2>
  <p>The Game may include virtual items such as coins or in-game scenery (collectively, “Virtual Items”). Virtual Items have no real-world monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash or any real-world goods or services.</p>
  <p>You understand and agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Virtual Items are licensed to you, not sold.</li>
    <li>Virtual Items may be earned by playing the Game or by watching rewarded advertisements.</li>
    <li>We may change, reset, limit, or remove Virtual Items at any time as part of balance changes, bug fixes, or other updates.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for any loss of Virtual Items due to uninstalling the Game, changing devices, or clearing local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Advertisements and Rewarded Ads</h2>
  <p>The Game may display ads from third-party advertising networks. The Game may also offer rewarded ads where you can choose to watch a video or interactive ad to receive Virtual Items, such as coins.</p>
  <p>We do not control the content of third-party ads. If you have concerns about a particular ad, you should contact the advertising network or follow any reporting options within the ad itself.</p>

  <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Game is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you play the Game.</p>
  <p>By using the Game, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Game, including but not limited to its name, logo, artwork, code, graphics, sounds, and design, are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.</p>
  <p>Except for the limited license granted in these Terms, you acquire no rights or ownership in the Game or any associated intellectual property.</p>

  <h2>6. Updates and Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update the Game at any time, including adding or removing features, fixing bugs, changing game balance, or modifying how Virtual Items work. We may also update these Terms from time to time.</p>
  <p>Continued use of the Game after an update means that you accept the updated Game and Terms.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Game at any time if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, misused the Game, or engaged in fraudulent or harmful behavior.</p>
  <p>You may stop using the Game at any time by uninstalling it from your device.</p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Game is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about the Game, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or availability.</p>
  <p>We do not guarantee that the Game will be error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or that any defects will be corrected.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of Virtual Items, or loss of enjoyment, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Game.</p>
  <p>In any case, our total liability for all claims related to the Game shall not exceed the amount you have paid us (if any) for using the Game.</p>

  <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Game may integrate services from third parties, such as advertising networks or analytics providers. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of those third-party services.</p>
  <p>Your use of third-party services may be subject to their own terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in your country or region, without regard to conflict of law principles, unless local laws require otherwise.</p>
